## Component Details



Component overview for Specialized Business Functions (Assets & Projects) in ERPNext, focusing on core components and their interactions for managing fixed assets and project lifecycles.



### Asset Management Core

This is the central component for managing the complete lifecycle of fixed assets. It handles the creation, tracking, and overall status of an asset, serving as the primary record for all asset-related operations. It integrates with financial modules for accounting purposes.

### Asset Depreciation & Valuation

This component is responsible for the financial aspects of assets, including calculating, scheduling, and posting depreciation entries. It also manages adjustments to an asset's book value, ensuring accurate financial reporting.

### Asset Capitalization & Movement

This component handles the process of adding costs to an asset's value (capitalization) and tracking the physical transfer of assets between locations or custodians. It ensures that the asset's cost basis is accurate and its location is known.

### Project Core

This is the central document for managing projects, encompassing their overall scope, tasks, costs, and progress. It serves as the primary organizational unit for all project-related activities.

### Project Task Management

This component manages individual tasks within a project. It allows for detailed planning, progress tracking, and managing dependencies between tasks, enabling effective project execution and resource allocation.

- <a href="https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/master/erpnext/projects/doctype/task/task.py#L1-L1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`erpnext/projects/doctype/task/task.py` (1:1)</a>





### Timesheet & Project Costing

This component is responsible for recording the time spent by employees on specific tasks or projects. This data is crucial for tracking project costs, calculating employee utilization, and generating client invoices based on time spent.
